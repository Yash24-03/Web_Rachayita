        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Getting started with HTML</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          To get started with HTML, all you need is a text editor and a web browser. You can create an HTML document using a basic text editor like Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac), and then open it in a web browser to see how it looks. There are also many free text editors available specifically for coding, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom.
